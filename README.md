# Bamazon

Bamazon is an Amazon-like storefront CLI app using MySQL and Node.js. It provides three different user options:
<ul>
    <li>Customer View</li>
    <li>Manager View</li>
    <li>Supervisor View</li>
</ul>

##Customer View

This option first displays all of the items available for sale.
It then prompts the user to enter the ID and number of units of the product they would like to buy.
